# AppleDecrypt (3.1.0)
Apple Protected Binary decryption kext for Lion and above.
I created this project for providing alternative decryption (not using “Dont Steal Mac OS X.kext”).
Current status is fully finished.
It uses Apple’s private corecrypto interface for the decryption.
Info on how to use this can be seen in the project.
